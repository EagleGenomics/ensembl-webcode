Doxygen-based Ensembl API documentation generator

Contact ktaylor@ebi.ac.uk for assistance (June 2011)
---------------------------------------------------
Short version:

Update the various docbuild files to include up to date version numbers and paths.
Run go-api.sh to do the complete build. It may take up to 2 hours, but is faster on
a rerun.
---------------------------------------------------

Long version for the script-averse:

Three components are required:

Doxygen (1.7.4 works well)
	- built from source bundle, using configure options to keep it in /software/ensembl/doxygen
	- if Doxygen is significantly updated, generate fresh layout.xml, header.html, footer.html, customdoxygen.css, and docbuild files, then add present configuration to them.
	- doxygen binary is in /software/ensembl/doxygen/bin

Custom filter (from ensembl CVS: ensembl-personal/ktaylor/doxygenfilter/)
	- consider using the layout.xml, html templates and so forth from the CVS checkout

--------------------------------------------------------

Runtime:

Check main configuration options held in *****_docbuild where ***** is the part of the Ensembl codebase. Key parameters in the docbuild file are:

PROJECT_NUMBER
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY (location for html to go in html/ subfolder
STRIP_FROM_PATH (to remove the leading parts of the path from the filenames in the documentation)
INPUT (path to root of source code to be processed)
EXCLUDE (so that test suites are not processed)
INPUT_FILTER (should refer to ensembldoxygenfilter.pl located in ensembl/misc-scripts/doxygen_filter)
GENERATE_HTML

If cross-references between e.g. funcgen and core are not showing, check GENERATE_TAGFILE and TAGFILES

Run the build on core first, then hive, then the rest. This allows cross-referencing.

----------------------------------------------------------

Dealing with errors:

The *****_error.log files contain the errors from the build process. Many are innocuous, such as "warning: found */ without matching /* while inside a \code block!". Regular expressions in the code can look a lot like the end of comments.

The line numbers given refer to the post-processed Perl module, so use the test.pl script that was bundled with the modified Perl filter to process the source to see what is wrong.

Other innocuous errors include "explicit link request to ... could not be resolved" and "warning: Unsupported xml/html tag".

"File ended in the middle of a comment block!" and "warning: documented function `public Arrayref results_file' was not declared or defined" can be indicative of bad POD in the source code.
