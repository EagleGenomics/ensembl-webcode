<h2>Servers</h2>


<h3 class="boxed">Setting up and running DAS Servers</h3>

<p>Setting up your own DAS server is straightforward and is ideal
for viewing large sets of data or annotations from your own site
in Ensembl or elsewhere.

DAS is an excellent collaboration tool, allowing you to
quickly and easily share data with other research labs.</p>


<h3 class="boxed">DAS Server Implementations</h3>

<p>Depending on the amount and type of data you have, 
there are different ways to run an annotation server to add
features to the Ensembl data or to other DAS client
implementations.  They vary in what programming language 
and web services your site needs to support.</p>

<h4>Dazzle</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.biojava.org/dazzle/">Dazzle</a> is a
Java based DAS server developed by Thomas Down at the 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute</a>.  It is an advanced and stable server
solution which runs as a servlet within either the Tomcat or
Resin servlet containers.  Both the Ensembl reference server and
the UniProt reference server are running Dazzle.
Dazzle is a good choice if you already are familiar with
e.g. Tomcat and/or Java.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.biojava.org/dazzle/">Dazzle home
page</a> contains a deployment guide for the server and also a
description of how to set up a mirror of the Ensembl reference
server.

<h4>ProServer</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/proserver/">ProServer</a>
is a Perl based DAS server developed by Roger Pettett at the
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>.  
Its strength is that it is
extremely light weight and modular.  It does not require any
pre-existing web server installation and it may be adapted to
serve DAS features from virtually any underlying data store.</p>

<p>ProServer is the server implementation that we recommend 
people try first, especially if they have Perl
programming skills in-house.</p>

<p>There are a number of documents describing how to set up
ProServer:</p>

<ul>
<li>
The <cite>ProServer installation guide</cite> <a
href="./proserver-guide.pdf">[pdf]</a> describes how to install,
configure and adapt ProServer.
</li>
<li>
<cite>Setting up the ProServer DAS server, a tutorial</cite>
<a href="./proserver_installation.pdf">[pdf]</a> is a tutorial
describing how to make ProServer work with an in-house version
of Ensembl at your site.  The tutorial mentions a number of
additional files that may be found here:
<ul>

<h4>
  Diplo
</h4>
<p>
  Diplo, by Andreas K&auml;h&auml;ri at the <a href=
  "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">The European Bioinformatics Institute</a>, is
  a DAS server in the same style as ProServer, i.e. it is a Perl-based
  DAS server which aims at being light-weight and modular and does not
  depend on any pre-existing web server installation.  The feature list
  of this implementation includes the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Streaming of result data.</li>
  <li>Plugins &amp; plugouts.</li>
  <li>Basic access restriction.</li>
  <li>Multi-sources.</li>
  <li>Source aliases.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~ak/diplo/">Diplo home page</a>
  contains an up-to-date list of features, the latest snapshot releases,
  and documentation.
</p>

<h4>LDAS</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://www.biodas.org/servers/">Lightweight
DAS server</a> (LDAS) was the first widely available DAS server
solution.  It was written in Perl by 
<a href="http://stein.cshl.org/">Lincoln Stein</a>, 
<a href="http://www.cshl.edu/">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a> (CSHL).  
It relies on a separate
MySQL database for storing all annotation features.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<cite>Setting up a Lightweight DAS server</cite> <a
href="./LDAS_setup.pdf">[pdf]</a> describes how to install LDAS
and its prerequisites.  Further information is available from the
<a href="http://www.biodas.org/servers/">LDAS home page</a>.
