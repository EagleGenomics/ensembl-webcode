<h2>Comparative Genomics</h2>

<h3>BlastZ-net Analysis</h3>

<p>BlastZ-net (<a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/1/103">Schwartz
S et al., Genome Res.;13(1):103-7</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/20/11484">Kent
WJ et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A., 2003;100(20):11484-9</a>)
alignments are provided for closely related pairs of species. The
alignments are the results of post-processing the raw BlastZ results.
In the first step, original blocks are chained according to their
location in both genomes. The netting process chooses for the reference
species the best sub-chain in each region. The reference species in the
BlastZ-net alignments is defined in this table:</p>

<h3>Translated Blat Analysis</h3>

<p>Translated blat (<a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656">Kent
W, Genome Res., 2002;12(4):656-64</a>) is used to look for
homologous regions between more distantly related pairs of species. We
expect to find homologies mainly in coding regions.</p>

<h3>PECAN Analysis</h3>

<p>Pecan is used to provide global multiple genomic alignments. First,
Mercator is used to build a synteny map between the genomes and then
Pecan builds alignments in these syntenic regions.</p>

<p>Pecan is a global multiple sequence alignment program that makes
practical the probabilistic consistency methodology for significant
numbers of sequences of practically arbitrary length. As input it
takes a set of sequences and a phylogenetic tree. The parameters and
heuristics it employs are highly user configurable, it is written
entirely in Java and also requires the installation of Exonerate.

<p>Additionally we use Gerp
(<a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/15/7/901">Cooper
GM et al., Genome Res., 2005; 15:901-913</a>) to calculate conservation
scores and call constrained elements on the 9 way multiple alignments.
Conservation scores are estimated on a column-by-column basis.
Constrained elements are stretches of the multiple alignment where the
sequences are highly conserved according to the previous score.</p>

<h3>Synteny Analysis</h3>

<p>We calculate syntenic regions using blastz-net alignments. We look for
stretches where the alignment blocks are in synteny. We do not allow gaps
longer than 100 kbp betweeen consecutive alignment blocks and we keep only
syntenic regions which are at least 100 kbp long.

<h3>Protein Homology Analysis</h3>

<p>Three types of homology relationships are provided.</p>

<p>Protein trees are calculated using the longest peptide of all
the Ensembl protein coding genes. Proteins are clustered based on
Best-Reciprocal Hits and Blast Score Ratios. Each cluster of protein is
aligned using Muscle. PHYML is used to get a gene tree from each
multiple alignment. The gene tree is reconciliated with the species
tree using RAP to root the tree and to call duplication events.</p>

<p>Homologues (orthologues and paralogues) are deduced from the
protein trees. A more detailed description of the method is provided <a href="homology_method.html">here</a></p>

<p>Families are groups of related genes. The full set of Ensembl
proteins is extended using all the metazoan proteins from SwissProt and
SPTrEMBL.</p>
