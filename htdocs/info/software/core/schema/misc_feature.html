<h2>Miscellaneous Features Tables</h2>

<p>
In general the Ensembl schema aims to give each feature type its own table.
This is somewhat impractical if you have only a small number of new features to introduce or if the new feature does not add any extra functionality.
</p>

<p>
A <strong>misc_feature</strong> is a general feature.
It can have a location (<strong>misc_feature.seq_region_id/start/end/strand</strong>), a number of self defined attributes (<strong>misc_attribute.value</strong>) and self defined attribute types (<strong>attrib_type.code</strong>).
Misc_features can belong to one or more sets of features (<string>misc_set</strong>).
</p>

<p>
The columns <strong>attrib_type.code</strong> and <strong>misc_set.code</strong> are used to identify a certain attribute type or misc set to the API. 
For display purposes the value in the name column should be used. 
The description column is optional.
