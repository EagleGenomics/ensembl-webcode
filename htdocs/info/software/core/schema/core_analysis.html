<h2>Analysis Table</h2>

<p>
The analysis table can be regarded as a bag of attributes needed to describe any analysis that produced features. 
These features should link to the respective analysis table entry.
</p>

<p>
From an API perspective the <strong>only relevant column</strong> in the analysis table is the <strong>logic_name</strong>.
It is used in some feature retrieval calls to specify which feature interests you.
All other columns are optional, but their intended use is as following:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
<strong>created</strong> is a date stamp created automatically when the analysis entry is stored.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>db</strong> contains the common name for a database, like "UniProt" or "EMBL".  If the filename is different from this name it is stored in <strong>db_file</strong>.
If this database is versioned this information should be stored in <strong>db_version</strong>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>program</strong> contains the name for the binary that produced the feature.
If the program cannot be located by name, its file system location should be stored in <strong>program_file</strong>.
Use </strong>program_version</strong> if you have version information.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>parameters</strong> contains the command line parameters for the file or general parameters for the module that was used.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>module</strong> contains a perl module name that produced the features. 
Use <strong>module_version</strong> if you have version information.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>gff_source</strong> and <strong>gff_feature</strong> are there to support gff dumps and should be filled according to the format.
</p>
</li>

</ul>
