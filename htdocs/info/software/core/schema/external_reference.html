<h2>External References Tables</h2>

<p>
Ensembl supports the link of external database entries to internal objects. 
This is currently only done on <strong>translation</strong> objects, but can be easily extended.
An external entry is described in the <strong>xref</strong> table and the database it comes from in <strong>external_db</strong>.
Any synonyms for the external entry are stored in <strong>external_synonym</strong>.
</p>

<p>Links to Ensembl are in the <strong>object_xref</strong> table.
Some links need additional information (attached to the link and not the external entry).
Derived GO identifiers are qualified by the way they were derived (<strong>go_xref.linkage_type</strong>).
External links that are derived from aligned peptides are annotated with the alignment details in <strong>identity_xref</strong>.
