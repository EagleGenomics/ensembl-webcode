<h2>Sequence Region Tables</h2>

<p>
The <strong>seq_region</strong> table provides information about every piece of DNA inside Ensembl that is intended for feature storing.
Not every <strong>seq_region</strong> has to be associated with sequence.
The name part should only contain the following characters [_a-zA-Z.0-9].
</p>

<p>
The <strong>dna</strong> table provides sequence data for a sequence region.
In order to be retrievable by the API, the <strong>seq_region</strong> has to be connected to the <strong>sequence_level</strong> coordinate system.
The length of the sequence has to be the length of the <strong>seq_region</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>dna_c</strong> table can contain 2-bit compressed dna sequence.
This is done by the API and should not be tried manually.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>coord_system</strong> table describes a coordinate system.
Typical examples would be <strong>chromosome</strong>, <strong>contig</strong>, <strong>chunk</strong>, <strong>clone</strong> etc.
The version is meant to distinguish coordinate systems that have sequence_regions of the same name with different content, like chromosome names in different assemblies.
The rank indicates the level of context in this coordinate system.
Rank 1 is the broadest e.g. <strong>chromosome</strong>, lower ranks have less context (meaning smaller <strong>seq_regions</strong>).
</p>

<p>
The <strong>assembly</strong> table states which parts of seq_regions are exactly equal.
It enables transformation of coordinates between seq_regions.
Typically this contains how chromosomes are made of contigs, clones out of contigs, and chromosomes out of supercontigs.
It allows you to artificially chunk chromosome sequence into smaller parts.
</p>

<p>
Every <strong>seq_region</strong> can have arbitrary <strong>attributes</strong> associated with it.
These are stored in the <strong>seq_region_attrib</strong> table.
The API currently knows about the <strong>toplevel</strong> attribute.
A <strong>seq_region</strong> with that attribute is considered to represent its sequence in the broadest possible context.
