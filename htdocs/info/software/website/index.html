<h3 class="boxed">Extending Ensembl</h3>

<p>
The new version of the web code is designed to make it much easier to write <strong>custom views</strong> for use on your local installation of Ensembl.

<h3 class="boxed">Additional technical documentation</h3>

<p>
More information about the object model used by the Ensembl web code will be added here.
Note that the new code design allows users to program their own pages without having to understand how the really technical stuff works "under the bonnet"!
</p>
<p>
  As a taster of the new code - we have a short PowerPoint presentation:

<h3 class="boxed" id="browsers">Supported browsers</h3>

<h4>Fully supported</h4>
<p>The following browsers are fully supported, i.e. all site features including
JavaScript and CSS styles should work properly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox - all versions</li>
<li>Mozilla 1/Netscape 6 (and higher) - all versions</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 5.0 (and higher) for Windows</li>
<li>Camino - Mac</li>
<li>Safari - Mac</li>
<li>Opera 7 (and higher) - all versions</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" title="Get Firefox!">Firefox</a> for browsing Ensembl.</p>

<h4>Mostly supported</h4>
<p>In some recent browsers, all content is available but rendering of a few elements is buggy. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IE5 for Mac</strong> has some CSS layout bugs, so that for example,
columns of text may be rendered one below another instead of side-by-side.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Minimally supported</h4>
<p>Older browsers such as Netscape Navigator 4 should be able to display most 
pages in their basic form (albeit without colours or columnar layout) but some 
elements will not work, e.g. JavaScript popup menus. 
There are no plans to further support these obsolete browsers.</p>
