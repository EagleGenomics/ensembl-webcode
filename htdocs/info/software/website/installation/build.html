  <h2>Building/Installing an Ensembl Website</h2>

<p>
The build instructions are split into three sections:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="non-ensembl-code.html">How to install other applications required by Ensembl</a><br />
    CVS, Perl, MySQL, Apache 2, Dotter</p></li>
  <li><p><a href="ensembl-code.html">How to install the Ensembl and BioMart software</a></p></li>
  <li><p><a href="ensembl-data.html">How to install the Ensembl data</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
  The first of these involves the installation of applications/modules that are not part of the Ensembl
  project but are necessary for the web site to work, such as Apache and MySQL. The second involves 
  installing the Ensembl data, modules and web site code.
</p>

<h4 class="boxed">Ensembl and MySQL</h4>
<p>
  PLEASE NOTE - even if you do not wish to download all the Ensembl data - for the website to function
  you will need:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a local database server to manage display settings and user accounts (if these are enabled).</li>
  <li>the mysql client software installed on your machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you do not wish to run MySQL (or cannot run a MySQL server locally) <strong>AND</strong> you do not
  wish to enable user accounts then you can alternatively install SQLite as an alternative server.
</p>

<h4 class="boxed">Ensembl Version Numbers...</h4>
<p>
  Each Ensembl release has an integer version number associated with it, and that version number is
  used to identify the correct versions of API, Web code and databases (see below) that make up that
  release.
</p>
<p>
  For the API and Web code, a CVS branch (essentially a named snapshot of the code) is made for each
  release, named with the release version number. The current release is version [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]],
  and the CVS tag for identifying the API and Web code for this release is 'branch-ensembl-[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]'.
</p>

<p>
  The Ensembl database names consist of the species, the database type, the release number, and the
  data version. The current human 'core' database is named homo_sapiens_core_[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]_[[SPECIESINFO::Homo_sapiens:SPECIES_RELEASE_VERSION]]. i.e. a
  human core database, release [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]], data version [[SPECIESINFO::Homo_sapiens:SPECIES_RELEASE_VERSION]] built on the NCBI 36 assembly. Subsequent data
  releases on the same assembly are suffixed with a lower case letter (a, b, etc.).
</p>

<p>
  The idea is that components with the same release version should work together - i.e. any web site built
  with 'version 31' API and web code, and 'version 31' databases should work correctly.
