  <h2>Issues installing Ensembl Website</h2>

<h3 class="boxed"><a name="whichfile">Which configuration files do I edit?</a></h3>
<p>
  Ensembl contains a number of ini-files with the same name - why?
</p>
<p>
  This is to make configuration easier for subsequent releases, if you make your
  changes to the mirror configuration for your local install (e.g. machine names
  etc), then this should not change significantly between releases and you can
  copy this file from one release to the next.
</p>
<p>
  You should change these files only - do not make changes to the configuration
  files in the main server directory - public-plugins/ensembl.
</p>
<h3 class="boxed"><a name="accounts">The main Ensembl website has user accounts can we enable them on our mirror.</a></h3>
<p>
  To enable accounts add the following to your SiteDefs.pm:
</p>
<pre>
  $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_LOGINS                 = 1;
</pre>
<h3 class="boxed"><a name="sqlite">Configurations are not stored if I don't have a local MySQL server?</h3>
<p>
  If you fo not need to install a local MySQL server (because you are pointing to the ensembldb.ensembl.org databases,
  then you can use SQLite. Install SQLite as outlined in the non-Ensembl code page and then include the SQLite plugin in
  in to your Plugins.pm file. <strong>NOTE:</strong> only session storage (not user/group) is supported in this case.
