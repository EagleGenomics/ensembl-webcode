<h2>Ensembl User Accounts</h2>

<div class="notice">
<p>Please note that all Ensembl data remains <a href="/info/about/disclaimer.html">free access</a>. It is <strong>not</strong> necessary to register in order to 
gain access to Ensembl data. 
</div>

Ensembl now allows users to register, login and save information between sessions, as well as share customisations with co-workers via Ensembl Groups. This page includes a brief introduction to the new account system.

<h3>Ensembl users</h3>
To use the new customisation features, visitors are asked to register for an Ensembl account. Once registered, you'll be able to save bookmarks, view configurations and make other customisations to Ensembl. You'll also have an account home page, which lists all your details and customisations. In particular, we think these features will be particularly useful for:

<ul class="spaced">
<li>Users who move from one computer to another frequently, e.g. between lab and office, or between 
more widely-separated locations.</li>
<li>Users who share a computer, e.g. in a lab situation, but use different web features or different
parts of the web site.</li>
<li>Groups of users who want to share settings, as an aid to collaboration</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Get started by <a href='/common/user/register'>registering for an account.</a></b>. Registration is free, and takes about 2 minutes.
</p>

<h3>Ensembl groups</h3>
In addition to customising your own Ensembl pages, the new accounts system also promotes collaboration, in the form of Ensembl groups. Users will be able to create new groups and join existing ones, and then share their configurations and bookmarks with other members of the same group.
<br /><br />
For example, an experienced Ensembl user in a research group could set up contigview for a specific purpose (turning on DAS sources, removing unnecessary features etc), and then share this setup with colleagues by creating a new group, and inviting others to join it.
<br /><br />
Any user can create a new group, although access to those groups is by invitation only. Only the creator of the group can manage it.

<h3>Getting started and more information</h3>

<h3>We're looking for your feedback</h3>
We're pleased to introduce Ensembl accounts and groups in Ensembl 42, and We're looking for feedback on the registration and account managment process. In particular, we'd love to know about:

<ul>
  <li>Registering, logging in and logging out</li>
  <li>Creating and managing groups</li>
  <li>The group invitation system</li>
 <li>Saving and sharing configurations</li>
  <li>Whether the registration process is usable</li>
  <li>Where we might need additional prompts and documentation<li>
  <li>If the interface needs any tweaks</li>
  <li>Broken links, typos or anything else untoward</li>
</ul>
