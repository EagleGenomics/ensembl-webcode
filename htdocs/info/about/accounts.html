<h2>Ensembl User Accounts</h2>

<h3>Why User Accounts?</h3>

<div class="notice">
<p>Please note that it is <strong>not</strong> necessary to register in order to 
gain access to Ensembl data. All our data remains <a href="/info/about/disclaimer.html">free access</a>, 
as it always has done.</p>
<p>Only external data uploaded by individuals or groups will be restricted to those users, in
accordance with the policies described in our <a href="/info/about/privacy.html">privacy statement</a>.
</div>

<p>Our user account system is designed to make this website more useful to visitors. We anticipate 
it will be particularly valuable in the following scenarios:</p>


<ul class="spaced">
<li>Users who move from one computer to another frequently, e.g. between lab and office, or between 
more widely-separated locations.</li>
<li>Users who share a computer, e.g. in a lab situation, but use different web features or different
parts of the web site.</li>
<li>Groups of users who want to share settings, as an aid to collaboration</li>
<li>Groups of users who need to restrict access to confidential data but do not have the resources
to set up their own copy of Ensembl.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Account features</h3>

<p>Please note that this list may not be exhaustive, as the user account system is under continuous 
development.</p>
