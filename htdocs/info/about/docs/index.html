<h2>Additional Documentation and Resources</h2>

<p>Whilst the primary goal of this website is to display the automated predictions
generated by our software pipeline, we have also made additional background
information available for users who are interested in the annotation process
and related projects at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.</p>

<h3 class="boxed">Annotation</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Ensembl Gene Set</strong> - 
The Ensembl genome browser provides a non-redundant set of transcripts and
genes annotated with the automated Ensembl genome analysis and annotation
pipeline.

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>CCDS</strong> - 
The CCDS project is a collaborative effort to identify a core set of protein-coding 
regions that are consistently annotated and of high quality.

<li>
<p>
<strong>Gene-building on the 2x genomes</strong> - 
The influx of low-coverage genomes has presented a particular challenge to the 
Ensembl genebuild process, and a new methodology has been developed to cope with 
this type of assembly.

<li>
<p>
<strong>Exonerate</strong> - 
Exonerate is a generic tool for pairwise sequence comparison. It allows you to align sequences using many alignment models, using either exhaustive dynamic programming, or a variety of heuristics.

<p>
<strong>Wise 2</strong> -
Wise2 is a package focused on comparisons of biopolymers, commonly DNA sequence and protein sequence. Algorithms in this package include genewise and estwise.

<li>
<p>
<strong>Comparative Genomics tools</strong> -
Ensembl uses a range of software tools, many developed in-house, to align
sequence from different species and identify homologues, syntenous regions
and conserved areas of the genome. <a href="compara/">More...</a>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>Microarray Probe Set Mapping</strong> - 
Ensembl maps microarray probe sets to the genome sequence and to Ensembl
transcripts if manufacturers provide sequences evidence for individual probe
sets.

</ul>

<h3 class="boxed">Sequencing</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>BAC Clone Ordering</strong> - 
The Ensembl project provides genome annotation and visualisation of the
annotated genomes. 
Ensembl however does not directly sequence or assemble genomes nor does it
provide clones.
Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones can be ordered from other sources.

<strong>Gene Trap Resource</strong> - 
A major goal in functional genomics is to elucidate the function of each of the
30,000 or so genes in the mammalian genome.
Gene trapping in mouse embryonic stem cells is a powerful and cost-effective
approach to create large numbers of insertional mutations in mice that are
immediately accessible to molecular characterisation.

<p>
<strong>MICER</strong> - 
The aim of the Mutagenic Insertion and Chromosome Engineering Resource (MICER)
is to provide vector sequences and information on using MICER vectors for
generating knockout mice, and for chromosome engineering.

<strong>NOD BAC clones</strong> - 
The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a model for diabetes.
