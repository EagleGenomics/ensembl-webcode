<h1>API &amp; Software</h1>

<p>All of the software created by the Ensembl project is open source
and freely available to download from our 
<a href="http://cvs.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/?root=ensembl">CVS repository</a>.</p>

<h2>Perl API</h2>

<p>The Perl API provides an abstraction layer for accessing the genomic
databases. Our <a href="/info/docs/api/">documentation</a> includes tutorials 
for typical tasks, and you can also browse the 
<a href="/info/docs/Doxygen/">module-by-module POD</a> output in the Doxygen 
web format.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>In addition to the API, we provide a number of Perl scripts that use
the API to run common data analyses. All of these can be run on the command
line, and some can also be run via a web front end, so you don't even need
to install any software! <a href="/info/docs/tools/">Learn more</a>...</p>

<h2>eHive production system</h2>

<p>Many of our pipelines and back-end data processing is managed using 
<a href="/info/docs/eHive/">eHive</a>, a job flow system written in Perl.</p>

<h2>Web code</h2>

<p>You can also run a local copy of this website by 
<a href="/info/docs/webcode/">installing our codebase</a> and associated Perl 
dependencies. Please note that this is a non-trivial task, and we only support 
installation on Linux. For help with other operating systems as well as general
support with custom development, we recommend joining our developers' 
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/about/contact/mailing.html">mailing list</a>.</p>
