MySQL Workbench was used to create schema diagrams for the core database.
In case of schema changes, update the relevant diagram (extension .mwb) and regenerate the diagram pdf.

To regenerate core_schema.html use script sql2html.pl in ensembl/misc-scripts/ with the following options:

-i (sql file name) table.sql
-o (html file name) 
-d (database) Core
-v (release) 72
-intro (html file name to append at the beginning of the file) intro.html
