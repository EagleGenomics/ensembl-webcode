MySQL Workbench was used to create schema diagrams for the core database.
In case of schema changes, update the relevant diagram and regenerate the diagram pdf.

To regenerate core_schema.html use script sql2html.pl in ensembl/misc-scripts/ with the following options:

-i (sql file name) table.sql
-o (html file name) 
-sort 0 (1- sort tables and table sets in alphabetical order)
-d (database) Core

Follow instructions in file html_to_append.html to complete the generated HTML and save as core_schema.html.
