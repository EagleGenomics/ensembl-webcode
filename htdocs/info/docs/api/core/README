MySQL Workbench was used to create schema diagrams for the core database.
In case of schema changes, update the relevant diagram (extension .mwb) and regenerate the diagram pdf.

To regenerate core_schema.html use script sql2html.pl in ensembl/misc-scripts/ with the following options:

-i (sql file name) table.sql
-o (html file name) 
-sort_headers 0 (1- sort in alphabetical order)
-sort_tables 0
-d (database) Core

Follow instructions in file html_to_append.html to complete the generated HTML and save as core_schema.html. Change the schema version to the current release in the following paragraph:
<p>
This document refers to version <strong>64</strong> of the EnsEMBL
core schema.
</p>
