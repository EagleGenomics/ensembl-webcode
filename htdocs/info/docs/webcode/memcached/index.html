<h1>Ensembl Memcached integration</h1>

<p>
Memcached is a distributed memory object caching system.<br />  We are
using memcached to speed up website by caching lots of things in
EnsEMBL, such as paths to pluggable static files, semi-static rendered
html pages, generated images, image-maps, some database query results
and a lot more.<br />  To get to know more about memcached in general
apply here:
<a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">http://www.danga.com/memcached</a>
</p>

<div class="notice"><strong>Important note</strong>: EnsEMBL would not
run with standard memcached installation, we slightly changed
memcached server to suit our needs.<br />  Major idea of this
modification is to be able to apply tags for the items stored in
memory, so that there's a way to delete lots of items at once by tags.
</div>

<p>
new functions: <br />
<b>tag_add <i>tag</i> <i>key</i></b> - adds tag for the key <br />
<b>tag_delete <i>tag</i></b> - deletes all keys with given tag <br />
<b>tags_delete <i>tag1</i> <i>tag2</i> ...</b> - deletes keys which
have all given tags <br />
</p>

The modified source code for memcached server could be found in
public-plugins/memceched/src, alternatively you
