<h1>Installing the Ensembl and BioPerl modules</h1>

<p>If you review the Site Structure part of this document, you will recall that the site is based around a
single server-root directory. The Ensembl and BioPerl modules are all installed into this
directory.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong>: we no longer recommend installing BioMart as part of your Ensembl site.
We have had to hack the code to integrate it, and our hacks are not in public CVS. If you would like to
use BioMart, we suggest either linking to a public BioMart or, for your own data, setting up a BioMart
instance using the new standalone Tomcat-based interface, available from 
<a href="http://www.biomart.org/">biomart.org</a> (currently version 0.8, rc6).</p>

<p>Choose a suitable location, and create your server-root directory. For the purposes of
illustration, we will use /usr/local/ensembl. When following these instructions, replace /usr/local/ensembl 
with your chosen server-root.</p>

<div class="tinted-box">
<p><b>Important notice</b>: As of Release 75 we will be moving development into git. 
For the next several releases, the new branch will still be made available via CVS 
at release time, but there will be no further work on the CVS HEAD.
Please see our <a href="http://www.ensembl.info">blog</a> for announcements about 
access to the new git repositories.</p> 
</div>

<ol>
<li>Go to the server-root directory:
<code>cd /usr/local/ensembl</code>
</li>

<li id="cvs_co"><strong>Install the Ensembl modules</strong>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Clone Ensembl git tools from GitHub</p>
  <pre class="code">
$ git clone https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-git-tools.git
$ export PATH=$PWD/ensembl-git-tools/bin:$PATH
</pre>
  </li>
  <li><p>To check out the most recent stable version of the ensembl API and web code from GitHub you need to use the latest branch of the code. This will be set as the default branch in GitHub.</p> 
  <pre class="code">
$ git ensembl --clone web
</pre>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>N.B. You can also <a href="https://github.com/Ensembl" rel="external">view the Ensembl GitHub repository</a> in your web browser.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Install the BioPerl modules</strong>

<div class="embedded-box info-box">
<p class="space-below"><strong>Important note</strong>: Recent versions of BioPerl 
are compatible with the Ensembl API but <em>not</em> with the current, rather old, 
blastview code.</p>
<p class="space-below">If you wish to install BLAST/BLAT on your mirror site, you will need to find a copy 
of BioPerl <strong>version 1.2.3</strong> (unfortunately no longer available through
the BioPerl CVS repository), not a more recent version. Starting with 1.2.4, major
changes were made to the BioPerl API which make it incompatible with Ensembl blastview.</p> 
<p>We will be launching a new Ensembl BLAST interface and parser in early 2014
which will remove this problem.</p> 
</div>

  <ol>
  <li><p>Log into the BioPerl CVS server (using a password of: cvs):</p>
  <pre class="code">cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.open-bio.org:/home/repository/bioperl login</pre>
  </li>
  <li><p>Check-out the BioPerl code:</p>
  <pre class="code">cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.open-bio.org:/home/repository/bioperl \
&nbsp; co bioperl-live</pre>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>A listing of your server-root should now look something like:</p>
  <pre>
ensembl
ensembl-compara
ensembl-funcgen
ensembl-git-tools
ensembl-orm
ensembl-tools
ensembl-variation
ensembl-webcode
public-plugins</pre>

</li>
</ol>

<p>You should now have all the Ensembl website code and data installed and ready to configure.</p>
