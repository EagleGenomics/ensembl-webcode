<h1>e!gineering: Ensembl web code architecture</h1>

<p>
The following pages cover some of the high-level programming concepts
behind the Ensembl web code. We offer this documentation for anyone
interested in the underlying architecture, particularly those interested 
in setting up a custom Ensembl-based website (i.e. not a mirror).
<strong>Please note</strong>: the Ensembl web code is subject to change 
without notice.
