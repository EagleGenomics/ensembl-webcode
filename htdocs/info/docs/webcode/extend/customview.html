<h1>Creating a simple custom view</h1>

<p>Creating a dynamic page which shows a selection of data from one of the Ensembl databases is fairly straightforward.</p>

<h2>Creating the page</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create a directory in your plugin to contain your custom code. If you want to put your code in the mirror plugin, it should be<br /><kbd>public-plugins/mirror/modules/EnsEMBL/Web</kbd></li>
<li>Decide on the Action for your new page. For example if you are basing your view around gene information, your URL might be <br />&lt;species&gt;/Gene/MyViewName</li>
<li>Create a module which will add this URL to the available views. In our example, <kbd>public-plugins/mirror/modules/EnsEMBL/Web/Configuration/Gene.pm</kbd> will extend the current set of gene-based displays:
<pre class="code">
package EnsEMBL::Web::Configuration::Gene;

use strict;

sub modify_tree {
  my $self = shift;
  
  $self-&gt;create_node('MyViewName', 'My Possibly Long Title for this View',
    [],
    { 'availability' =&gt; 'gene', 'concise' =&gt; 'My Short Title' }
  );
}

1;
</pre>
<p>This will add your view to the bottom of the lefthand menu, and provides a framework to which HTML output components will be attached (see below).</p>
<p>The 'concise' parameter is optional, and is a way of configuring an alternative, short name for your view that will appear in links (e.g. in the lefthand menu).</p>
</li>
<li>Create the components that will output the HTML. Let's say you want your page to include an image with a table underneath; you may find it easiest to create two separate components, <kbd>EnsEMBL::Mirror::Component::Gene::MyViewImage</kbd> and <kbd>EnsEMBL::Mirror::Component::Gene::MyViewTable</kbd>. Below is a Component template that can be used as the basis of any simple view:
<pre class="code">
package EnsEMBL::Mirror::Component::Gene::MyViewImage;

use strict;

use base qw(EnsEMBL::Web::Component::Gene);

sub _init {
  my $self = shift;
  $self-&gt;cacheable(1);
  $self-&gt;ajaxable(1);
  $self-&gt;configurable(0);
}

sub content {
  my $self = shift;
  
  ## The web 'object' is a wrapper around the Ensembl API object
  ## which a) makes the object extensible via plugins and
  ## b) usually includes methods that munge data into a web-friendly format
  my $object = $self-&gt;object;

  my $html;

  # Write your content-generating code here!

  return $html;
}

1;

</pre>
The easiest approach is to look at a page that has a similar display to the one you want, and modify a copy of that code.
</li>
<li>Add the list of components to the Configuration::Gene module you created earlier, in the empty arrayref:
<pre class="code">
$self-&gt;create_node('MyViewName', 'My Possibly Long Title for this View',
    [
      myviewimg     EnsEMBL::Mirror::Component::Gene::MyViewImage
      myviewtable   EnsEMBL::Mirror::Component::Gene::MyViewTable
    ],
    { 'availability' =&gt; 'gene', 'concise' =&gt; 'My Short Title' }
  );
</pre>
</li>
<li>Restart your server, and your completed page should now be accessible on your Ensembl installation!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Important note</h3>
<p>You will note that the example in stage 3 has the package name <kbd>EnsEMBL::Web::Configuration::Gene</kbd>, while the one in stage 4 is <kbd>EnsEMBL::Mirror::Component::Gene::MyViewImage</kbd>.<br />
When writing a plugin for an existing module, use the <kbd>EnsEMBL::Web</kbd> namespace.<br />
In this situation the only functions you need to write are ones which replace existing functions, using the same function name (overwriting), or completely new functions (extending).<br />
You do not even need the <kbd>use base</kbd> statement.<br />
When writing a plugin for a new module, as in stage 4, use the <kbd>EnsEMBL::Mirror</kbd> namespace (where "Mirror" is whatever you've chosen as your plugin's namespace). These modules must be written in their entirety.
</p>

<h3>Custom data calls</h3>

<p>If your new components need data that is not already available through the standard Object::Gene module, you can extend the module in the same way as Configuration and Component code:</p>
<pre class="code">
package EnsEMBL::Web::Object::Gene;

use strict;

sub my_gene_info {
  my $self      = shift;
  my $api_obj   = $self-&gt;Obj; ## Bio::Ensembl::Gene object
  my $gene_info = {};

  ## Make API calls here!
  foreach my $trans (@{$api_obj-&gt;get_all_Transcripts()}) {
    ...
  }

  return $gene_info;
}
