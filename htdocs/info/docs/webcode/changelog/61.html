<h1>Web Code Changelog - Release 61</h1>

<h2>Session table</h2>

<p class="space-below">There has been a schema change to the <kbd>session_record</kbd> table 
in the <kbd>ensembl_web_user_db</kbd> database.</p>

<p class="space-below">As we do not provide dumps of this database, you MUST run the script 
<kbd>/utils/update_session_record.pl</kbd> when updating to the new code for this release, 
otherwise track configuration will no longer be stored correctly. This script both alters the 
table and updates all existing configurations to work with the new code.</p>

<p>Further changes to this table will probably be coming over the next few releases.</p>

<h2>ZMenu plugins</h2>

<p class="space-below">ZMenu plugins now work in the same way as the rest of the code.</p>

<p>Previously all modules matching the required namespace would be called, starting from 
the most important plugin and ending with the core code. Now only the first matching namespace 
will be used, and as a result plugin code should be changed to call <kbd>$self->SUPER::content</kbd> 
in the <kbd>content</kbd> function where required.</p>

<h2>Static server</h2>

<p class="space-below">Ensembl can now serve static files - images, css and javascript - from a different URL, 
specified in SiteDefs as <kbd>$ENSEMBL_STATIC_SERVER</kbd>. This change reduces server load as cookies will not be 
registered for the static domain.</p>

<p>If no <kbd>ENSEMBL_STATIC_SERVER</kbd> variable is set, the site will behave as it did previously.</p>
