<h1>Web Code Changelog - Release 62</h1>

<h2>Large file formats</h2>

<p class="space-below">To support the increasing number of large file formats being added to 
Ensembl, the Custom Data section of the control panel has been simplified, with 'Attach BAM File' 
now merged into 'Attach URL Data'. Format-specific modules in <kbd>EnsEMBL::Web::Command::UserData</kbd> 
and <kbd>EnsEMBL::Web::Component::UserData</kbd> have been removed and any functionality merged into
generic modules such as <kbd>EnsEMBL::Web::Command::UserData::AttachRemote</kbd>.</p>

<p class="space-below">Additional large file formats include BigWig and VCF. Note that these are 
not enabled by default, as you will also have to install the necessary file-handling tools. 
Formats can be enabled individually in <kbd>DEFAULTS.ini</kbd> as follows</p>

<p><kbd>USERDATA_REMOTE_FORMATS = [BAM BigWig VCF]</kbd></p>
