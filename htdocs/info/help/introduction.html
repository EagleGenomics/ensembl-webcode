<h2>Welcome to Ensembl Accounts</h2>
Ensembl now allows users to register, login and save information between sessions, as well as share customisations with co-workers via Ensembl Groups. This page includes a brief introduction to the new account system.

<h3>Ensembl users</h3>
To use the new customisation features, users are asked to register for an Ensembl account. On registering a new user is asked to verify their email address, and receives a welcome message via email. Once registered and logged in, additional links will appear on the front page species list, and in the side bar. Each user also has an account page, which lists their details and allows them to manage their customisations.  

<h3>Ensembl groups</h3>
In addition to customisation, the new accounts system also promotes collaboration, in the form of Ensembl groups. Users will be able to create new groups and join existing ones, and then share their configurations and bookmarks with other members of the same group.
<br /><br />
For example, an experienced Ensembl user in a research group could set up contigview for a specific purpose (turning on DAS sources, removing unnecessary features etc), and then share this setup with colleagues by creating a new group, and inviting others to join it.  
<br /><br />
Any user can create a new group, although access to those groups is by invitation only. Only the creator of the group can manage it.
