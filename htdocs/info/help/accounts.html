<h1>Managing your account</h1>

<h2>Registering</h2>

<p>In order to use the new customisation features of Ensembl, you will need to register with us.</p>
<ol class="spaced">
<li>Fill in our <a href="/common/register">registration form</a>. We need an email address to use as your login "name" - the rest is optional.</li>
<li>To verify your email address, We'll send you an email with an activation code. Just click on the link in the email, or paste the address into a web browser to confirm your email address.</li>
<li>You'll be prompted to choose a password, and then be automatically logged in.</li>
</ol>

<p>For quick access to your customisation options, click on "Show account" in the "Your Ensembl" menu on the left of each page. A box will slide down from the blue bar, showing your bookmarks and view configurations. To see more options, click on the "Your account" link in the top left of this box.</p>

<p>For more information about using your account, see <a href="custom.html">Customising Ensembl</a>.</p>

<h2>Updating your details</h2>

<p>You can update your account details at any time by going to your <a href="/common/accountview">account home page</a> and clicking on the "Update details" link in the side bar.</p>

<h2>Lost passwords</h2>

<p>If you lose your password, we can send a new activation code to your email address so you can set a new password.</p>

<p>Note that if you lose your password <em>and</em> no longer have access to your registered email account, you will need to re-register, and your old bookmarks, etc., will be lost.</p>
