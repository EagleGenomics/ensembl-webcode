<h2>Ensembl Courses</h2>


<h3 class="boxed">One day workshops</h3>

<p>The Ensembl user support team has developed an extensive one-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training approach to Ensembl.
This course is regularly hosted in academic institutions worldwide.
</p>


<dl>
  <dt>Course topics</dt>
  <dd>The standard course lasts one day but there is some flexibility in content.
      Access to our MySQL databases and an introduction to the APIs can be covered if the course
      is extended to 2 days.</dd>
  <dt>Cost</dt>
  <dd>Host must pay travel, accommodation and subsistence expenses for the tutor. There is 
    an additional charge for companies but not for academic institutes. 
    For overseas locations (<i>i.e.</i> USA and Asia) we try to coordinate several venues so that institutes can share travel expenses.</dd>
  <dt>Room requirements</dt>
   <dd>The course requires an IT room of 25-30 computers with internet connection.
       There must be a way for one of the machines to be projected.</dd>
