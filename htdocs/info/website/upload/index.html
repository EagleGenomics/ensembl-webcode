<h2 id="addtrack">How to add custom tracks</h2>

<p>Your custom tracks are  managed using the pop-up control panel, accessed through the 'Manage your data' button under the left-hand menu.</p>

<p>You can add a track from any species-specific page, but it will only be displayed on suitable Location views, such as 'Region in Detail'.</p>

<h3>Ways to add tracks to Ensembl</h3>
<ol>
<li>Upload a file to our servers (max 5MB), from either your own computer or a location on the web (URL-based data).</li>
<li>Attach a URL, from which the file will be read each time you visit a page that has the track on</li>
<li>Attach a DAS (Distributed Annotation System) source, either from your own DAS server or anywhere else on the internet.

</ol>

<h3>Coordinate Systems</h3>

<p>
Use either <a href="coords.html">chromosome</a> or (finished) 
<a href="coords.html#bacclone">BAC clone coordinates</a> in custom data sets.
</p> 

<h3 id="Displaying">Displaying Data on Whole Chromosomes</h3>

<p>
You can display uploaded and/or attached user data on the karyotype, or the
chromosome diagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on either <strong>Whole genome</strong> or <strong>Chromosome summary</strong> 
at the left of any Location page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Configure this page</strong> button below the left-hand menu.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>User attached data</strong> link in the lefthand menu and select any tracks you would like to display.</li>
<li>Click on the 'tick' button to <strong>Save and Close</strong> the window and view the data.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: for large data sets, your display options will automatically be limited to density plots rather than individual feature points.</p>
</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="access">Data access and security</h2>

<h3>Saving tracks</h3>

<p>Uploaded data is saved temporarily to our filesystem and accessed
via cookie, so you can only view it from the browser in which you 
uploaded it. For longer-term access to your data, you can save the 
track to our database server, but this requires an Ensembl user account.
Once logged in, you will see a 'Save' link next to your track - click
on this and the track will be transferred to the database and can be
accessed on any computer where you are logged into Ensembl.</p>

<p>Remote data is not saved to the database. Only the URL or source
name is saved to your user account, to allow you to access the file
easily from any location, without having to reattach it.</p>

<h3 id="DeletingTracks">Deleting tracks</h3>

<p> 
The track will remain on your display while you navigate around the
genome. To hide the track, choose the "no display" option (empty box)
for that track in the <strong>Configure this page</strong> menu.</p>

<p>To remove the data set, click the <strong>Manage your data</strong> 
link at the left of Location. Click <strong>Manage data</strong> at the left of the
window. The tracks you have currently uploaded and/or attached will
be listed. Click delete next to any you wish to remove.
</p>

<h3 id="Disclaimer">Data Upload Disclaimer</h3>

<p>
Although your data source is allocated a unique ID and any management
operations on saved data (<i>e. g.</i> deleting) require a
password, <strong>this is only trivial security</strong>. Data
uploads are made on an <strong>open, non-secure</strong> network
connection. If your data is sensitive you should not upload it but
contact Ensembl for more information.
</p>

<p>
While we undertake everything to not make uploaded data available to
any person other than the originator we <strong>DO NOT</strong>
provide any assurance whatsoever concerning data security and/or
privacy.
</p>

<p>
If you are concerned about data privacy you should consider setting up
your own secure DAS server.
