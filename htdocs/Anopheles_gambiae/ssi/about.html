<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Anopheles_gambiae.png" height="55" width="95" alt="Mosquito Ensembl" class="float-left" title="um umm blood!"> Ensembl presents the tenfold whole genome shotgun assembly ("MOZ2") of the PEST strain of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, as prepared by <a href="/Anopheles_gambiae/collab_info.html">The International Anopheles Genome Project</a> [March 2002]. The assembled portion of the genome is about 278 Mbp in length with a total of 8,987 unique scaffolds, the largest scaffold being 23.1 Mbp.</p>

<p>Approximately 82% of the sequence has been assigned to chromosomal 
locations; chromosome arms 2L, 2R, 3L, 3R, and X are represented by 9, 
 20, 20, 8, and 10 large scaffolds respectively.
 No scaffolds have yet been assigned to the Y chromosome. Ensembl shows the unassigned scaffolds, concatenated together in arbitrary order, as an artificial unknown 'chromosome' (UNKN).</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>Ensembl re-annotated the assembly in October 2003 (release 2a) to provide improved genome-wide sets of gene, transcript and protein predictions, plus additional information including new EST mappings, additional repeats (<a href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/misc/bg2/">library available</a>), and <i>ab initio</i> transcript predictions from Ian Korf's SNAP program. Protein predictions identified by collaborators as probably arising from bacterial contamination in the assembly were removed from the set in April 2004 (release 2b).</p>

<p>The genomic sequence and initial annotation of <i>A. gambiae</i> was published in October 2002 in Science (<a
	href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12364791&dopt=Abstract">abstract</a>). An <a
	href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=14747013&dopt=Abstract">update</a> appeared in Trends in Parasitology. See also this EMBL <a href="/Anopheles_gambiae/documents/press.pdf">press release</a> (PDF).</p>
