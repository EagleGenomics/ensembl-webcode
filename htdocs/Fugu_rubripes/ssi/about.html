<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Fugu_rubripes.png" height="65" width="100" alt="pufferfish" class="float-left" title="Bloop bloop">This site presents version 3 of the Fugu genome, released in July 2002 by the <a href="http://www.fugu-sg.org/project/info.html">International Fugu Genome Consortium</a>. <i>Fugu rubripes</i> has a very compact genome, with less than 15% consisting of dispersed repetitive sequence, which makes it ideal for gene discovery.</p>

<p>The latest assembly is based on 5.7X coverage of the genome, and includes 329 Mb of the 365 Mb genome.  Please refer to the <a href="http://www.fugu-sg.org">Fugu Project's Webpage</a> for more details of the sequencing effort.</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>Fugu Ensembl is a
joint project between the <a href="http://www.imcb.nus.edu.sg/">IMCB</a> and the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk">EMBL - EBI</a> to produce
and maintain an automatic annotation of the Fugu genome.</p>
