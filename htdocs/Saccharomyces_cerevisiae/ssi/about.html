<h3 class="boxed">About the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> genome</h3>

<h4>Assembly and Annotation</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.png" width="100" height="71" alt="Saccharomyces cerevisiae" class="float-left" />The data on this site is a direct import of the Saccharomyces Genome Database dataset for the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> S288C genome. No additional genebuild was carried out, but a series of blast runs was done to provide ESTs, Swall hits, and other similarity data.</p>
    
    <p>We have included <i>S.cerevisiae</i> into the Ensembl system to allow people to access the data through the Ensembl user interface (both for visualisation and data mining) and to provide cross-species integration through our comparative genomics resources (such as homologous gene links and protein family/domain pages).</p>

    <p>The canonical data for <i>S.cerevisiae</i> is managed at <a href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/">SGD</a>.</p>
