        This site presents an annotation of the first draft chicken
        genome assembly, March 2004 [<a href="http://www.genome.gov/11510730">NIH press release</a>].
        The chicken genome sequence was determined by whole genome shotgun at
        the <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/projects/chicken/">Genome
        Sequencing Center at Washington University, St Louis</a>. The analysis
        of the chicken sequence involves an international group of scientists
        including individuals from the US, UK, Europe and China.</p>

<h4>Warning</h4>

<p>This release of G. gallus CGAW contains some sequence that is not specific
to chromosome W.  A large portion of the sequence assigned to W was done so
based on the presence of W-specific repeats.  These repeats have now been shown
to be not specific to chromosome W.  Thus, the only portions of GGAW which should currently
be considered specific to W are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/Gallus_gallus/contigview?chr=W&vc_start=1&vc_end=195831">Chr W, bases 1 - 195831</a></li>
    <li><a href="/Gallus_gallus/contigview?chr=W&vc_start=4895452&vc_end=4916845">Chr W, bases 4895452 - 4916845</a></li>
    <li><a href="/Gallus_gallus/contigview?chr=W_random">All of Chr W_random</a></li>
</ul>
