<h3 class="boxed">About the Zebrafish genome</h3>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Danio_rerio.png" width="121" height="50" alt="Zebrafish" class="float-left" />The <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio">zebrafish
genome project</a> is a collaboration between the Sanger Institute and
the zebrafish community, announced during the <a
href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Info/Press/001121.shtml">Sanger Institute
Zebrafish Workshop 2000</a> and was started in February 2001.</p>

<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p>This Ensembl website features the zebrafish assembly version 5 (Zv5),  
as released on the 27th May 2005. This assembly was produced by  
integrating the whole genome shotgun assembly with data from the  
physical map (<a  
href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv5_assembly_information.shtml">more information</a>).</p>

<p>Datasets used for the analyses that were provided by collaborators are
acknowledged <a
href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/acknowledgements.shtml">here.</a></p>

<p>The zebrafish sequencing project is funded by the <a
href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a>.</p>

<p>You may <a href="/Danio_rerio/exportview">export</a> data
from this site.
Please see the  <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/use-policy.shtml">Conditions of use</a> for these data.</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p> This site provides a full Ensembl gene set for Zv5. This release
is based on a strategy where transcripts are generated based on
protein evidence and clustered in genes. Aligned zebrafish cDNA are
used to add UTR regions. Genes are named based on the alignment of
their coding regions to known entries in public database, in this
process ZFIN genes have priority.</p>

<p>
A number of Zebrafish clones have also been manually annotated in <a
href="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Danio_rerio/">Vega</a>, these genes are
currently accessible in zebrafish Ensembl through a DAS track.
