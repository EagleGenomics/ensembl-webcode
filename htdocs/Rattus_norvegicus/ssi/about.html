<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Rattus_norvegicus.png" height="75" width="140" class="float-left" alt="Rat" title="eeeeek! eeeek!">The latest build provides a preliminary data set based on the version 3.4 "November 2004 Update" of the rat genome assembly. In this update a 15 bp overhang was removed at the join between AABR03100354-AC117058 and the order was reversed for BACs AC133000 and AC136926. </p>
    
<p>The Rat Genome project is an international collaboration to sequence
	the genome of the brown rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>).  The DNA
	sequence is generated by <a

	Medicine</a>, <a href="http://www.celera.com">Celera Genomics</a>, <a
	href="http://www.genomecorp.com">Genome Therapeutics</a>, <a
	href="http://www.tigr.org/tdb/bac_ends/rat/bac_end_intro.html">The
	Institute for Genome Research</a>, and <a

	Columbia</a>.</p>
	
<p>The rat data used on this site can be downloaded directly from <a

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>Ensembl is working with the broader rat genomics community (<a
	href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/">RGD</a>) to provide annotation of the rat
	genome.</p>
