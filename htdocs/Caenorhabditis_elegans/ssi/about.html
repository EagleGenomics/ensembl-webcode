<h3 class="boxed">About the <i>C. elegans</i> genome</h3>

<h4>Assembly and Annotation</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Caenorhabditis_elegans.png" width="100" height="65" alt="C. elegans" class="float-left" />The data on this site is a direct import of the
Wormbase 140 dataset.  No additional genebuild was carried out, but a
series of blast runs was done to provide ESTs, Swall hits, and other similarity
data.</p>
    
<p>We have included <i>C.elegans</i> into the Ensembl system to allow people
    to access the data through the Ensembl user interface (both
    for visualisation and data mining) and to provide cross-species
    integration throught our comparative genomics resources (such as
    homologous gene links and protein family/domain pages).</p>

<p>The canonical data for <i>C. elegans</i> is managed at <a href="http://www.wormbase.org">Wormbase</a>.</p>
