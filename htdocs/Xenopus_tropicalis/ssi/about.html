<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Xenopus_tropicalis.png" height="90" width="100" class="float-right" alt="Xenopus" title="Bwarp!">The <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i> genome assembly <a href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Xentr3/Xentr3.home.html">version 3.0</a> [October 2004] is the third of a series of preliminary assembly releases by the JGI that are planned as part of the ongoing <i>X. tropicalis</i> genome project. The current assembly includes approximately 7x in small insert end-sequence coverage. This Ensembl website presents the sequence data provided by the JGI.</p>
         
<p>The assembly was constructed with the JGI assembler, Jazz, using paired end sequencing reads. After trimming for vector and quality, 19.1 Million reads assembled into 27,064 scaffolds totaling 1.63 Gbp. Roughly half of the genome is contained in 392 scaffolds, all at least 1.2 Mb in length.</p>
