<li><p><strong>New look'n'feel for the Ensembl website</strong><br />www.ensembl.org has had a major redesign, both on the surface and 'under the bonnet'. Most of the dynamic pages (e.g. ContigView, GeneView) have only minor cosmetic changes - in addition to the new template and stylesheets, some links have been moved from the body of the view to the new side-bar.<br /><a href="whatsnew.html#ncat-feature">Read more</a>...
