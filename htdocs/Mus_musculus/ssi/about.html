<h3 class="boxed">About the Mouse genome</h3>

<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p>Ensembl Mouse is based on the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/NCBIContigInfo.html">
NCBI m34 mouse assembly</a> (freeze May 17, 2005, strain C57BL/6J).

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Mus_musculus.png" height="80" width="130" class="float-right" alt="Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium" title="squeak squeak!">The Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium is a joint project between 
<a href="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/">The Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research</a>, 
<a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Washington University Genome Sequencing Center</a>, 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> 
and <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EMBL - EBI</a> to provide the Mouse genome sequence to the world. 
We work closely with other Mouse groups to provide an integrated resource (see below for credits).</p>
      
<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>This site provides a full Ensembl gene build for the above assembly. 
There are some major changes in the assembly; for more details see 
the <a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/mouse/contig/Build34.html" 
target="_new">NCBI build statistics </a>. The un-assembled pieces of 
the Y-chromosome will probably be re-integrated in the upcoming build 35.</p>

<p>Modifications to the systems have further improved the gene set. More 
than 93% of known genes from build m33 retain the same Ensembl gene ids in 
this release. Of novel genes only 55% of identifiers are retained, half of
those lost were pseudogenes.</p>
