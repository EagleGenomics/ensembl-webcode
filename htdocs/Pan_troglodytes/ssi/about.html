<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Pan_troglodytes.png" alt="chimpanzee" title="Oo ooo!" class="float-left" />This site provides a data set based on the November
	13th 2003 4x shotgun assembly from the Chimpanzee Sequencing 
        Consortium headed by the <a href="http://www.genome.wustl.edu/gsc/">GSC</a> (St. Louis) and <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">The Broad Institute</a> (MIT).</p>  
    
<p>The assembly is a merge of a "modified de
	novo" (MDN) assembly from the ARACHNE group, which used the human genome to establish that
	particular inserts were not chimeric, and a separate "validated
	chimp-on-human" (VCH) assembly which took the chimp reads which align
	uniquely to human, formed them into contigs via this alignment, and
	removed contigs which failed a two-haplotype consistency check.</p>
	
<p>Shared reads were used to align the two assemblies to each other, and where they were consistent, the VCH sequence was transferred to the MDN, resulting in the released merged assembly.</p>

<p>This release of the assembly has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>361782 contigs, having N50 length 15.7 Kb</li>
	<li>contig length total 2.73 Gb, spanning 3.02 Gb </li>
	<li>37849 supercontigs, having N50 length 8.6 Mb (not including gaps).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>The genome was aligned to human by UCSC using BLASTz. These alignments were used to transfer human gene structures (Human Build 34d) to chimpanzee. Owing to the low coverage commensurate with a 4x shotgun, there will inevitably be some mis-assemblies and mis-placements; however with better data it is expected that most chimpanzee genes will align with near-identical human genes.</p>
