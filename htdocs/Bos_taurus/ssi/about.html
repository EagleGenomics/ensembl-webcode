<h3 class="boxed">About the Cow genome</h3>

<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Bos_taurus.png" height="80" width="80" class="float-left" alt="Cow" title="Moo!">Btau_1.0 is a preliminary 3x assembly of the draft genome sequence of cow (Bos taurus), Hereford breed, using whole genome shotgun (WGS) reads from small insert clones. The project coordination and genome sequencing and assembly is provided by the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine.</p>

<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 of the contigs is 4.2 kb. The N50 of the scaffolds is 13.5 kb. The total length of all contigs is 2.26 Gb. When the gaps between contigs in scaffolds are included, the total span of the assembly is 2.34 Gb.</p>
 
<p>The fragmentary nature of this preliminary assembly leads to single gene 
structures being distributed across many scaffolds. In order to present 
as-far-as-possible complete gene structures, it was therefore necessary to 
assemble some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold" super-structures. There are 
10075 such gene-scaffolds, with identifiers of the form "GeneScaffold_1".</p>


<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>The standard Ensembl gene-build pipeline is unsuitable for low-coverage, 
fragmentary genomes such as this. It has therefore been necessary to 
devleop a new method that utilises a whole genome alignment (WGA) to an 
annotated, reference genome (in this case, Homo_sapiens). Cow gene 
structures have been derived largely by projecting human gene-structures 
through the WGA onto the cow sequence.</p>
