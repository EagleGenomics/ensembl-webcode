The data displayed on the Ensembl Fruitfly site is a compendium of data 
from different sources: The euchromatic sequence is based on BDGP
<a 
href="http://www.fruitfly.org/sequence/release4genomic.shtml">assembly 
release 4</a>,
whereas the annotations of the euchromatic regions displayed in Ensembl 
are based on data imported from flybase <a 
href="http://www.fruitfly.org/annot/release4.html">rel.4.1</a>
<a href="http://www.flybase.org/annot/dmel_release4.1.txt"> (dated 
20050207)</a>.</p>

<p>For the heterochromatic regions sequence was provided by DHGP (release 
3.2). The annotations on the heterochromatin are imported from 
gff-files published by flybase
<a href="ftp://ftp.dhgp.org/pub/DHGP/Release3.2b/">(release 3.2b2,</a>
<a hef="http://www.dhgp.org/index_release_notes.html"> dated 
20050110)</a>.
No additional gene build has been carried out, however repeats, blast 
hits from the Swall database and protein features have been computed 
through the Ensembl pipeline.</p>

<p>We have included Drosophila into the Ensembl system to allow people to
    access the Fly genome through the Ensembl user interface (both for
    visualisation and data mining) and to provide cross-species integration
    throught our comparative genomics resources (such as homologous gene links
    and family pages).</p>

<p>The canonical data for Drosophila is managed at <a
    href="http://www.flybase.org/">FlyBase</a> and we are working in
    partnership with them to provide feedback on their resources.</p>
