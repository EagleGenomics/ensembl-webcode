<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Ciona_intestinalis.png" height="131" width="100" class="float-left" alt="Ciona intestinalis" title="Ciona intestinalis">
<i>Ciona intestinalis</i> version 1.95 [<a href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/ciona4/">details</a>] is a whole genome shotgun assembly released by the JGI. 
The <i>Ciona</i> genome is the smallest of any experimentally manipulable chordate, and thus provides a good system for exploring vertebrate evolutionary origins. This Ensembl website presents the sequence data provided by the JGI, with additional Ensembl genebuild (see below).</p>
         
<p>The assembly release version 1.95 of the whole genome shotgun reads was constructed with the JAZZ assembly, using paired end sequencing reads at a coverage of 11X. After trimming for vector and quality, 3.9 million reads assembled into 2242 scaffolds, totaling 117 Mb. Roughly half the genome is contained in 136 scaffolds at least 234 kb in length.</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>The standard Ensembl mammalian pipeline was modified for annotation of the <i>Ciona</i> genome, owing to the lack of genomic information from closely-related species. Thus, in addition to aligning known <i>Ciona</i> proteins to the sequence (as per the standard pipeline), we aligned the large quantities of Ciona-specific cDNA and EST sequences against the genome, and then used protein data from other species to build additional gene models. <a href="/Ciona_intestinalis/genebuild.html">More details of the genebuild process</a>...</p>
