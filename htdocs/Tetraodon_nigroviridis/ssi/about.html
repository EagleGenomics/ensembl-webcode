<p>The Tetraodon genome project is a collaboration between <a href="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr">Genoscope</a> and the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu"> Broad Institute</a> (MIT). This Ensembl website presents 
sequence data and analyses provided by the two institutes.</p>

<p>The project was supported by the Consortium National de Recherche en 
Genomique and the National Human Genome Research Institute.</p>

<p>The genome assembly was performed using  <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/wga">Arachne</a> (Jaffe D.B. et. al. 2003. Gen. Res. 13, 91-96). This site 
presents version 7 of the assembly.</p>
         
<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>Genes were annotated by <a href="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr">Genoscope</a>,
 combining evidence from Geneid,
Genscan, Genewise and Exofish predictions with alignments of Tetraodon
cDNAs to the genome. This was done automatically using GAZE (Howe K.,
Chothia T. and Durbin R. 2002. Gen. Res. 12, 1418-27) with a
custom-designed configuration and gene structure model.</p>

<p>The annotation also includes 87 manually curated structures of a number of 
HOX and Cytokine genes.</p>
