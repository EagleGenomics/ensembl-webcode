<h4>Assembly</h4>
<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Apis_mellifera.png" height="87" width="100" alt="Bzzz, bzz!" title="Bzzz, bzz!" class="float-right"> This site presents an annotation of release 2.0 of the <a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/honeybee/">honeybee genome assembly</a> [January 2005].</p>
<p>The honeybee genome sequence was determined by whole
 genome shotgun at the Human Genome Sequencing Center at <a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/">Baylor College of Medicine</a>.
</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>
<p>The data comprises:</p>
<ul class="spaced">
    <li>Repeats which have been identified with:
        <ul>
            <li>RepeatMasker using the Drosophila melanogaster repeat library</li>
            <li>RepeatMasker, with repeat consensi provided using an <i>ab initio</i> analysis kindly performed by Damian Keefe of the EBI's ENCODE project using the RECON repeat-finding package</li>
            <li>Repeat sequences identified by the <i>ab initio</i> analysis which were not found by the RepeatMasker's drosophila library</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Low complexity sequence identified with Dust.</li>
    <li><i>Ab initio</i> gene predictions - which have been generated with Genscan and FGenesH</li>
    <li>Blast features - showing similarities to entries in Uniprot from a sensitive search against the genome.</li>
    <li>Gene predictions - These are grouped by confidence, and generated from a combination of evidence sources: honeybee-specific peptides, homology to Uniprot, and honeybee-specific ESTs. Lower confidence predictions are generated with homology to Uniprot only. </li>
</ul>
