This site provides the first gene annotation set based on the initial
release [<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/media/2004/doggenome_0714.html">July 2004</a>] from the <a href="/Canis_familiaris/credits.html">Dog Genome Sequencing consortium</a>.</p>

<p>The assembly is constructed from a WGS read coverage of 7.6x (Q20 bases, assuming a genome of 2.4 Gb).  It has an N50 contig length of 123 kb, N50 supercontig length of 41.6 Mb.</p>

<h4 style="clear:both;margin-top:3em">Annotation</h4>

<p>The gene build was run via a reasonably standard Ensembl mammalian pipeline, modifed to make optimal choices of source proteins for each gene. This initial analysis gives 20,439 genes with 32,546 transcripts, but lacks a number (around 700) of orthologs to human which seem placeable on the dog genome. We are investigating these in more detail and may release a patched dataset in 2005.</p>
