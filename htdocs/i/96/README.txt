96x96 icons. Generated with GIMP 2.6.8. Originals were 385 x 385 and the text written in DejaVu Sans Bold 46px with 8px extra leading, centred. These were then scaled to 96x96 using Linear interpolation (for decreased fuzz) and the text centred and the grey pixels which de-alias the bottom side of the baseline placed on row 93 with rulers. The "off" images were derived from the "on" by three repeats of setting lightness to 75 using HSV tool and saturation decreased by around 50, one time, until the colours are washed out to equivalent degrees to other images, determined by eye (varies on colour content of image).
