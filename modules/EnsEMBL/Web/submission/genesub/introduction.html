			<td><p><strong>Welcome to the Mosquito Gene submission pages</strong></p>

<p>The gene submission page allows biologists to request gene name assignments
for genes they have studied. It also allows detailed knowledge 
of the gene structure to be conveyed to Ensembl - Ensembl is planning
to update the mosquito database every 6 months and during the update we
will do everything possible to recapitulate the proposed gene structure.</p>

<p>The gene name assignments are human readable symbols suitable for 
publication. Submission of a gene name through this form
does not mean it has been accepted, as there are additional checks
which must be performed before we assign the symbol. We are following
guidelines agreed by the mosquito community and are outlined in the
 <a href="[[SCRIPT]]?action=guide">Guidelines</a> section. Researchers will be notified
when a gene symbol is assigned, if the gene you wish to submit has been 
experimentally verified and has been published (or will be published) we
also invite you to submit it to the <a href="http://www3.ebi.ac.uk/Services/webin/Sbm.cgi">
EMBL database</a>.</p>

<p>Ideally gene structures will be accompanied by direct cDNA sequencing
evidence or other experimental evidence. When submitting your gene name
you can identify other EMBL/Genbank sequences which correspond to your gene
(please, do not indicate the genomic sequence here).</p>

<p>Please provide conceptual cDNA of the gene, even if you have built a gene 
structure without experimental data. The conceptual cDNA is by far the
most robust way of indicating what you believe the gene structure is, as
it will be relevant even after updates to the genomic sequence.</p>

<p>We will warn you if you are submitting a cDNA with an open reading frame
less than 50 amino acids as it is likely that this is an error when
constructing the cDNA (however, small peptides and/or RNA genes do exist, so 
they will be accepted)</p>
