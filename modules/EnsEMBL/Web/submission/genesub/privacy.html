			information is required to submit gene-names using this tool. The data collected is to identify and contact the gene submitter if further information is required about a particular submission.</p>
    <P>Gene symbol submissions to this tool will be publically available by default. If particular gene symbol submissions are to be kept private the 'private' option should be selected from the 'status' drop down menu when submitting the particular gene symbol. When a gene symbol has been submitted with a private status, the gene will not be publically viewable, although genename curators and staff working on the EnsEMBL project will have access to the submission.</P>
    <p>Submissions can be changed by the owner of the gene submission, or by curators. Curators may wish to contact submitters to discuss particular gene symbol submission and to resolve any "errors" in that may have been made. Any changes made to a gene will be e-mailed to the owner. </p>
