			<td><b>Genename Submission Guidelines</b><p><small>The following rules for the naming of Anopheles gambiae genes were adopted by the International Anopheles Genome 
  Executive Committee and are based on the conventions recommended by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) for naming human genes.
  Submitters are urged to use these rules when naming genes or other genetic structures to avoid unsystematic 
  and duplicate names. Please note that these are a consice set of rules for naming gene on this site, a complete and more detailed set can be
  found on the <a href="http://www.anobase.org/AnoBase/names.html" target="AnoBase">AnoBase</a> web site.</small>
    
<ol>
<li><small>The names are mnemonic symbols (abbreviations) designed for easy recall. They do <b>not</b> aim to summarize all current information about a
 gene and such information should be added to the description, Xref or other appropriate field.</small>  
</li>

<li><small>The gene symbols should remain brief, specific and unique. They should not exceed a length of 6 or 7 characters unless this is essential.</small></li>

<li><small>To avoid errors in electronic communication all names consist exclusively of capital letters of the Latin alphabet and Arabic 
numerals; no punctuation marks, dashes etc. are to be used.</small></li>

<li> <small>The gene name consists of two to three contiguous fields, as follows:</small>
<table><tr><td><ul type="disc">
<li><small>The first field includes three to five letters and is an abbreviations of the highest sequence grouping used, usually a
protein family, e.g. CLIP (for Clip-domain serine protease), or SCR (for Scavenger Receptor) </small></li>

<li><small>The second field, if present, includes one or more letters identifying a subgroup such as subfamily (e.g. CLIPD), or class
(e.g. SCRB).</small></li>
<li><small>The third field enumerates each gene by using consecutive numerals (e.g. SCRB1).  Sometimes the third field numeral can be 
preceded by letter(s) indicating gene types within a subgroup (e.g. SCRBQ1, for a gene belonging to the SCRB Class, and to the croquemort type). </small></li>
<li><small>For historical reasons, in certain families, the third field can also enumerate by letters rather than numerals (e.g. PGRPLA, for gene A of the Long subfamily in
the PGRP family). </small></li>
</ul></td></tr></table></li>

<li>
  <small>Taxonomic prefixes or suffixes (Ag, a etc) are omitted. See AnoBase for <a
  href="http://www.anobase.org/AnoBase/spec_abbr.html" target="AnoBase">Species Abbreviations </a></small></li>

<li><small>The name is based on sequence similarities and carries no functional implications, which must be determined experimentally. </small></li>

<li>
 <small>Should a name be identified, which do not agree with the following rules, the author will be contacted and alternatives
  will be suggested. The "incorrect" name can be kept as a synonym, while a valid name will be assigned to the gene or genetic
  structure.</small></li>

<li>
  <small>It is recommended that names previously used in the literature or in database submissions be gradually replaced by
  systematic names, following consultation with the original author. Historical names or names that may be developed
  eventually to indicate experimentally verified function or orthology can be used as synonyms.</small></li>
