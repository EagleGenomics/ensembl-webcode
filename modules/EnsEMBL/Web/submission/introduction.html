			<td><p><strong>Welcome to the Mosquito submission pages</strong></p>

<p>The submission page allows biologists to submit gene symbol assignments for genes they have studied, and also transposable element information to Ensembl. The submissions will be added into the ensembl databases every new Anopheles release to be displayed within the ensembl genome browser and we will do everything possible to recapitulate the submitted data. Please note that login details created with the genename submission tool can also be used to submit transposon information.</p>

The gene name assignments are human readable symbols suitable for 
publication. Submission of a gene name through this form
does not mean it has been accepted, as there are additional checks
which must be performed before we assign the symbol. We are following
guidelines agreed by the mosquito community and are outlined in the
 <a href="[[SCRIPT]]?action=guide&guide=genesub">Guidelines</a> section. Researchers will be notified
when a gene symbol is assigned, if the gene you wish to submit has been 
experimentally verified and has been published (or will be published) we
also invite you to submit it to the <a href="http://www3.ebi.ac.uk/Services/webin/Sbm.cgi">
EMBL database</a>. Ideally gene structures will be accompanied by direct cDNA sequencing
evidence or other experimental evidence. When submitting your gene name
you can identify other EMBL/Genbank sequences which correspond to your gene
(please, do not indicate the genomic sequence in this instance).
<br /><br />
As submitted transposon sequences will be mapped by Ensembl there is no need to submit location
information. Only an identifier, family and full transposon sequenece is required for each
submission, other anotation data can be added if requires such as synonym and feature location . 
The transposon identifier should follow the preliminary <a href="[[SCRIPT]]?action=guide&guide=transposon">Guidelines</a> for naming and the family name should be selected
from the drop down list. If the family name is not listed then select 'other' and after the transposon has been submited the family name can be added to the family list. 
Because the family name will be used for other submissions please be careful when entering the name and follow the naming guidelines. 
This submission tool is still under development, if you have any problems or suggestions to improve the submision process please <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/helpdesk/">contact us</a>.</p>
